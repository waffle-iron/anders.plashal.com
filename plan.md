Taken inspiration from Carmack, I'd like to document the happenings of this project. What i thought would be a quick turnaround progressed into a whirl-wind exorcise in [murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law). Crashed hdds, Monitors falling off mounts, a forced windows upgrade and a new baby on the way. I've tried my best to correct and compensate and we're still kicking over here, pushing out updates on the daily. With a need to update and migrate my work to a standardized development environment, I begin with [anders.plashal.com](http://andres.plashal.com).

sometimes you gotta burn the village down and rebuild. i hate to do it since it's time consuming but there's too many loose database tables and bit of code showing up. 
- re installed wordless stack/ theme stack included
- cleaned out database tables,
- cleared cloudfront cdn cache

	Figuring out the breakpoints to this stack was pretty crazy and time consuming. finally figured it out and now i can integrate the slider rev break points to get a pretty seamless experience. on a site note renew settings are horribly organized. super disappointing, took me all morning to hunt down the break points and have them confirmed.
