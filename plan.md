Taken inspiration from Carmack, I'd like to document the happenings of this project. What i thought would be a quick turnaround progressed into a whirl-wind exorcise in [murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law). Crashed hdds, Monitors falling off mounts, a forced windows upgrade and a new baby on the way. I've tried my best to correct and compensate and we're still kicking over here, pushing out updates on the daily. With a need to update and migrate my work to a standardized development environment, I begin with [anders.plashal.com](http://andres.plashal.com).

Figuring out the breakpoints to this stack was pretty crazy.
