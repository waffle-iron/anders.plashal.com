Number of apps available in leading app stores as of June 2016 are as follows:

Google Play: 2.200.000 apps
Apple App Store: 2.000.000 apps
Windows Store: 669.000 apps
Amazon App Store: 600.000 apps
Blackberry World: 284.500 apps

In the best case scenario, an application is only one application in 2 million apps. Do you know there are 2.000.000 species of living creatures living in oceans, seas, lakes and rivers not only fish I am talking about all species? So increase your designation probability but it is not enough, also, you have to engage your application with users. You can do both by building a social community. That is your question’s answer ‘Social Community’.
