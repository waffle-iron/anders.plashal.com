In an attempt to calculate the total number of hours that I have been working in the advertising industry, I've had to break down days, working hours and so on. 

The total number of days between Sunday, July 1st, 2001 and Friday, October 28th, 2016 is 5,599 days. This equals to 15 years, 3 months, and 27 days. Breaking that down further, we get 799 weeks or 3,999 weekdays (Monday through Friday) and 1,599 weekend days, now we have to exclude public holidays. Below is a list:
