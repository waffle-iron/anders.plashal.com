## User Experience  ##

- 01 **One Column Layout** instead of multicolumn.
	A one column layout will give you more control over your narrative. It should be able to guide your readers in a more predictable way from top to bottom. Whereas a multi column approach runs some additional risk of being distracting to the core purpose of a page. Guide people with a story and a prominent call to action at the end.

- 03 **Merge Similar Functions** instead of fragmenting the UI.
	Over the course of time, it's easy to unintentionally create multiple sections, elements and features which all perform the same function. It's basic entropy - things start falling apart over time. Keep an eye out for duplicate functionality labelled in various ways, as it puts a strain on your customers. Often, the more UI fragmentation there is, the higher the learning curve which your customers will have to deal with. Consider refactoring your UI once in a while by merging similar functions together.

- 06 **Distinct Clickable/Selected Styles** instead of blurring them.
	Visual styling such as color, depth, and contrast may be used as a reliable cue to help people understand the fundamental language of navigating your interface: where am I, and where can I go. In order to communicate this clearly to your users, the styles of your clickable actions (links, buttons), selected elements (chosen items), and plain text should be clearly distinct from one another and then applied consistently across an interface. In the visual example, I've chosen a blue color to suggest anything that can be clicked on, and black as anything that has been selected or indicates where someone is. When applied properly, people will more easily learn and use these cues to navigate your interface. Don't make it harder for people by blurring these three functional styles.

- 07 **Recommending** instead of showing equal choices.
	When showing multiple offers, then an emphasized product suggestion might be a good idea as some people need a little nudge. I believe there are some [psychology studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html?_r=0) out there which suggest that the more choice there is, then the lower the chances of a decision actually being made and acted upon. In order to combat such analysis paralysis, try emphasizing and highlighting certain options above others.

- 09 **Telling Who It's For** instead of targeting everyone.
	Are you targeting everyone or are you precise with your audience? This is a conversion idea where you could be explicit about who exactly your product or service is intended for. By communicating the qualifying criteria of your customers, you might be able to actually connect more with them while at the same time hinting at a feeling of exclusivity. The risk with this strategy of course is that you might be cutting yourself short and restricting potential customers. Then again, transparency builds trust.

- 10 **Be Direct** instead of indecisive.
	You can send your message with uncertainty trembling in your voice, or you can say it with confidence. If you're ending your messaging with question marks, using terms such as "perhaps", "maybe", "interested?" and "want to?", then most likely you have some opportunity to be a bit more authoritative. Who knows, maybe there is a bit more room for telling people what to do next in the world of conversion optimization.

- 11 **More Contrast** instead of similarity.
	Making your calls to action be a bit more prominent and distinguishable in relation to the elements surrounding them, will make your UI stronger. You can easily increase the contrast of your primary calls to action in a number of ways. Using tone, you can make certain elements appear darker vs. lighter. With depth, you can make an item appear closer while the rest of the content looks like it's further (talking drop shadows and gradients here). Finally, you can also pick complementary colors from the color wheel (ex: yellow and violet) to raise contrast even further. Taken together, a higher contrast between your call to action and the rest of the page should be considered.

- 13 **Fewer Form Fields** instead of asking for too many.
	Human beings are inherently resistant to labor intensive tasks and this same idea also applies to filling out form fields. Each field you ask for runs the risk of making your visitors turn around and give up. Not everyone types at the same speed, while typing on mobile devices is still a chore in general. Question if each field is really necessary and remove as many fields as possible. If you really have numerous optional fields, then also consider moving them after form submission on a separate page or state. It's so easy to bloat up your forms, yet fewer fields will convert better. Evidence Exists For A [+7.6% Effect From This Idea](http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?13)

- 14 **Exposing Options** instead of hiding them.
	Each pull down menu that you use, hides a set of actions within which require effort to be discovered. If those hidden options are central along the path to getting things done by your visitors, then you might wish to consider surfacing them a bit more up front. Try to reserve pull down menus for options that are predictable and don’t require new learning as in sets of date and time references (ex: calendars) or geographic sets. Occasionally pull down menu items can also work for those interfaces that are highly recurring in terms of use - actions that a person will use repeatedly over time (ex: action menus). Be careful of using drop downs for primary items that are on your path to conversion. Evidence Exists For [A +50.8% Effect From This Idea](http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?14)

- 15 **Suggesting Continuity** instead of false bottoms.
	A false bottom is a conversion killer. Yes, scrolling long pages are great, but be careful of giving your visitors a sense that the page has come to an end somewhere in between sections where it really hasn't. If your pages will scroll, try to establish a visual pattern or rhythm that the user can learn and rely on to read further down. Secondarily, be careful of big gaps in around the areas of where the fold can appear (of course I’m referring to a area range here with so many device sizes out there).

- 16 **Keeping Focus** instead of drowning with links.
	It’s easy to create a page with lots of links going left and right in the hope of meeting as many customer needs as possible. If however you’re creating a narrative page which is building on towards a specific call to action at the bottom, then think twice. Be aware that any link above the primary CTA runs the risk of taking your customers away from what you’ve been hoping them to do. Keep an eye out on the number of links on your pages and possibly balance discovery style pages (a bit heavier on the links) with tunnel style pages (with fewer links and higher conversions). Removing extraneous links can be a sure way to increase someone’s chances of reaching that important button. Evidence Exists For [A +5.6% Effect From This Idea](http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?16)
- 18 **Benefit Buttons** instead of just task based ones.
	Imagine two simple buttons displayed on a page. One button tells you that it will “Save You Money”, while the other one asks you to “Sign Up”. I’d place my bets that the first one might have a higher chance of being acted on, as a sign up on it’s own has no inherent value. Instead, a sign up process takes effort and is often associated with lengthy forms of some sort. The hypothesis set here is that buttons which reinforce a benefit might lead to higher conversions. Alternatively, the benefit can also be placed closely to where the action button is in order to remind people why they are about to take that action. Surely, there is still room for task based actions buttons, but those can be reserved for interface areas that require less convincing and are more recurring in use. Evidence Exists For [A -8.3% Effect From This Idea](http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?18)

- 30 **Loss Aversion** instead of emphasizing gains.
	We like to win, but we hate to lose. According to the rules of [persuasive psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion), we are more likely to prefer avoiding losses than to acquiring gains. This can be applied to how product offerings are framed and communicated. By underlying that a product is protective of a customer’s existing well-being, wealth or social status, such strategy might be more effective than trying to provide a customer with something additional which they don’t already have. Do insurance companies sell the payout that can be gained after the accident or the protection of the things we hold dear to us?

## Type & Measurement ##

- [Approximate Conversions: Points> Pixels> Ems> %](http://reeddesign.co.uk/test/points-pixels.html)
- [CSS Font-Size: em vs. px vs. pt vs. percent](http://kyleschaeffer.com/development/css-font-size-em-vs-px-vs-pt-vs/)

 Meet the Units: **1em** = **12pt** = **16px** = **100%**
 - **“Ems” (em)**: The “em” is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt. Ems are scalable in nature, so 2em would equal 24pt, .5em would equal 6pt, etc. Ems are becoming increasingly popular in web documents due to scalability and their mobile-device-friendly nature.
 - **Pixels (px)**: Pixels are fixed-size units that are used in screen media (i.e. to be read on the computer screen). One pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest division of your screen’s resolution). Many web designers use pixel units in web documents in order to produce a pixel-perfect representation of their site as it is rendered in the browser. One problem with the pixel unit is that it does not scale upward for visually-impaired readers or downward to fit mobile devices.
 - **Points (pt)**: Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). One point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. Points are much like pixels, in that they are fixed-size units and cannot scale in size.
 - **Percent (%)**: The percent unit is much like the “em” unit, save for a few fundamental differences. First and foremost, the current font-size is equal to 100% (i.e. 12pt = 100%). While using the percent unit, your text remains fully scalable for mobile devices and for accessibility.

## Copy Writing ##

**5 Steps to Concise Copy**: [Source](https://www.portent.com/blog/random/5_steps_to_concise_copy.htm)

Brevity is the soul of wit (Lord Polonius in Shakespeare’s Hamlet)
Online, concise copy will always get better results than verbose copy.
How can I make that sentence shorter and give it more oomph?

1. **Dump the passive voice.**
Online, concise copy ~~will always get~~ gets better results than verbose copy.

2. **Get rid of meaningless words.** Concise copy is always better, right? Plus folks are reading this online.
~~Online,~~ Concise copy ~~will always get~~ gets better results than verbose copy.
3. **Get rid of repeated words.**
In copy, concise ~~copy~~ gets better results than verbose~~copy~~.

4. **Replace four words with one.**
In copy, concise ~~gets better results than~~ beats verbose.

5. **Make sure it reads OK.** In this case, I’m not thrilled with my phrasing. A little rejiggering does the trick:
Concise copy beats verbose.

The result is better. **This:**
Online, concise copy will always get better results than verbose copy.
**became this:**
Concise copy beats verbose.
